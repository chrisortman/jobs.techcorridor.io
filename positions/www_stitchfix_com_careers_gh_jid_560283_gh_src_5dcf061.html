  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stitch Fix is an online personal styling startup in San Francisco, combining art and science to disrupt and redefine the retail industry. Our engineering teams build the tools that run our business, from our customer-facing website and mobile app to unique and innovative tools that power our warehouse, merchandising, and styling teams. We leverage vast amounts of client data to make decisions throughout the company. All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our customers and a successful, growing business. We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity, and we’re looking for incredible people to contribute!</span></p>
<h1><strong>About Engineering</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team is made up of key engineers who built and scaled organizations like Google, Netflix, eBay, and LivingSocial. We build modern software with modern techniques like TDD, continuous delivery, DevOps, and service-oriented architecture. Cross-functional partnership is deeply meaningful to us, and is how we’ve built up immense trust with the people running the business. &nbsp;We focus on high-value products that solve clearly identified problems, and design them in a sustainable way. &nbsp;In fact, some of our proudest moments come from solving business problems without writing a line of code.</span></p>
<h1><strong>About the Role</strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Principal Engineer you will drive the architecture and design of our developer tools products. &nbsp;You’ll work with our platform engineers to deliver a secure, scalable, and reliable set of development and deployment tools for our entire engineering team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be knee-deep on technical decisions and implementation, but will always maintain a vision for where these tools should go and how they should work. &nbsp;You’ll work with key leaders on our engineering team to make sure developers are productive and have the agency to manage the systems they build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success in this role requires a fierce dedication to delivering results, incorporating feedback, and making improvements. The ability to quickly understand problems specific to our team and our business—and help solve them pragmatically—is a key to success.</span></p>
<h2><strong>About the Technology</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technologies we use to solve problems include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby on Rails</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Postgres</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RabbitMQ</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Angular / React</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>We get excited about engineers who have...</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Real Technology Experience.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You define how we build software. You have a deep understanding of how to evolve systems for scale.

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Systems Thinking.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp;You see the forest for the trees and can easily conceptualize how what you are doing fits within a larger design.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A Bias to Action.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once you’re pointed at a problem, you work to solve it quickly and effectively. &nbsp;You don’t get lost in analysis and drive your efforts on providing value and delivering results.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Respect for the Craft.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You build software sustainably, using modern techniques. You are always looking for more and better ways to write software, and can’t wait to share them with your team.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Respect, Empathy, and Humility.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect, regardless of the circumstance.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Bonus Points</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience working collaboratively as a distributed team—we use GitHub, Heroku, Slack, and Blue Jeans to get stuff done online.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are good at prototypes and design discussion—experience using pull requests, one-pagers, or screencasts to create rapid prototypes that demonstrate new features.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience with testing and CI—we're working with the usual Ruby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests and use CircleCI to bring it all together.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have experience in distributed, service-oriented architecture—we’re using tools like RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, and headless HTTP services to scale our team and software.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>You'll love working at Stitch Fix because we...</strong></h2>
